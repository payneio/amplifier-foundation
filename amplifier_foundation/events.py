"""
Cross-session event routing.

Provides pub/sub infrastructure for sessions to communicate via events.
This enables event-driven orchestration patterns where:
- Background sessions can notify parent sessions of completion
- Sessions can react to events from other sessions
- Triggers can spawn sessions based on event patterns

Example:
    router = EventRouter()

    # Subscribe to events
    async for event in router.subscribe(["work:completed"]):
        print(f"Work done: {event.data}")

    # Emit an event
    await router.emit("work:completed", {"task_id": "123"}, session_id="abc")

    Routes events between sessions.

    Provides a simple pub/sub mechanism for cross-session communication.
    Sessions can emit events and subscribe to events from other sessions.

    The router supports:
    - Multiple subscribers per event name
    - Wildcard subscriptions (["*"] receives all events)
    - Source session filtering (only receive from specific sessions)
    - Non-blocking emit (full queues log warning but don't block)

    Example:
        router = EventRouter()

        # Subscribe to events
        async for event in router.subscribe(["work:completed"]):
            print(f"Work done: {event.data}")

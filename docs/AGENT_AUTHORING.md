# Agent Authoring Guide

Agents are specialized AI configurations that run as sub-sessions for focused tasks.

**Key insight: Agents ARE bundles.** They use the same file format and are loaded via `load_bundle()`. The only difference is the frontmatter key (`meta:` vs `bundle:`).

→ For file format, tool/provider configuration, @mentions, and composition, see **[BUNDLE_GUIDE.md](BUNDLE_GUIDE.md)**
→ For agent spawning and resolution patterns, see **[PATTERNS.md](PATTERNS.md)**

This guide covers only what's **unique to agents**.

## Quick Comparison: Agent vs Bundle

| Aspect | Bundle | Agent |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Frontmatter key | `bundle:` | `meta:` |
| Required fields | `name`, `version` | `name`, `description` |
| Loaded via | `load_bundle()` | `load_bundle()` (same!) |
| Purpose | Session configuration | Sub-session with focused role |

```yaml
# Bundle frontmatter          # Agent frontmatter
bundle:                        meta:
  name: my-bundle                name: my-agent
  version: 1.0.0                 description: "..."
```

## The `meta.description` Field: Your Agent's Advertisement

**This is THE critical field for agent discoverability.** The coordinator and task tool see this description when deciding which agent to delegate to.

### What Makes a Good Description

Answer three questions:
1. **WHEN** should I use this agent? (Activation triggers)
2. **WHAT** does it do? (Core capability)
3. **HOW** do I invoke it? (Examples)

### Pattern

```yaml
meta:
  name: my-agent
  description: |
    [WHEN to use - activation triggers]. Use PROACTIVELY when [condition].
    
    [WHAT it does - core capability in 1-2 sentences].
    
    Examples:
    
    <example>
    user: '[Example user request]'
    assistant: 'I'll use my-agent to [action].'
    <commentary>[Why this agent is the right choice]</commentary>
    </example>
```

### Real Example

```yaml
meta:
  name: bug-hunter
  description: |
    Specialized debugging expert. Use PROACTIVELY when user reports errors,
    unexpected behavior, or test failures.
    
    Examples:
    
    <example>
    user: 'The pipeline is throwing a KeyError somewhere'
    assistant: 'I'll use bug-hunter to systematically track down this KeyError.'
    <commentary>Bug reports trigger bug-hunter delegation.</commentary>
    </example>
    
    <example>
    user: 'Tests are failing after the recent changes'
    assistant: 'Let me use bug-hunter to investigate the test failures.'
    <commentary>Test failures are a clear debugging task.</commentary>
    </example>
```

### Anti-Patterns

```yaml
# ❌ Too vague - when would you use this?
meta:
  description: "Helps with code stuff"

# ❌ No examples - callers have to guess
meta:
  description: "Analyzes code for quality issues"

# ✅ Clear triggers + capability + examples
meta:
  description: |
    Use PROACTIVELY when user reports errors or test failures.
    Systematic debugging with hypothesis-driven root cause analysis.
    
    <example>
    user: 'The build is failing'
    assistant: 'I'll use bug-hunter to investigate.'
    </example>
```

## Instruction Structure

The markdown body after frontmatter becomes the agent's system prompt. Recommended structure:

```markdown
# Agent Name

[One-line role description]

**Execution model:** You run as a one-shot sub-session. Work with what 
you're given and return complete results.

## Operating Principles
1. [Principle 1]
2. [Principle 2]

## Workflow
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

## Output Contract

Your response MUST include:
- [Required element 1]
- [Required element 2]

---

@foundation:context/shared/common-agent-base.md
```

**Always end with the @mention** to include shared base instructions (git guidelines, tone, security, tool policies).

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Vague Description
Callers don't know when to use the agent. Add activation triggers and examples.

### 2. Missing @mention Base
Forgetting `@foundation:context/shared/common-agent-base.md` causes inconsistent behavior.

### 3. No Output Contract
Callers don't know what to expect back. Define what the agent returns.

### 4. Treating Agents as Different from Bundles
Agents ARE bundles. Don't reinvent - use the same patterns from BUNDLE_GUIDE.md.
